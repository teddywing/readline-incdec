NAME
----
incdec - Readline bindings to increment and decrement numbers

SYNOPSIS
--------
Incdec bindings

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A pair of Readline bindings and Bash functions to quickly increment and
decrement a number on the current command line.

BINDINGS
--------
*__readline_incdec_decrement (C-x x)*::
	Decrement the first number to the left of point by one. If no number
	is on the left of point, the first number to the right of point is
	decremented.

*__readline_incdec_increment (C-x a)*::
	Increment the first number to the left of point by one. If no number
	is on the left of point, the first number to the right of point is
	incremented.

CUSTOM BINDINGS
---------------
Custom bindings can be defined by mapping to the increment and decrement
functions. For example, this defines bindings for 'C-x -' and 'C-x +':

	bind -x '"\C-x-": __readline_incdec_decrement'
	bind -x '"\C-x+": __readline_incdec_increment'
